									<h2><a >Mobile AR Neurosurgical Trajectory Planning Prototype<br /></a></h2>
								</header>
								<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/MSTP.png" /></a>
								<p>A Mobile Augmented Reality Neurosurgical Trajectory Planning Protoype made using Unity. <br />
									This prototype scans an image target to render a patient's Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) as a virtual object on the mobile device.
									The user can then manipulate the object in order to place a target point at the center of the object.
									The point placement is done by having the user raycast two lines through the STN, placing the point at the intersection of the two lines.<br />
									Once this step is complete, the virtual object becomes the patient's brain with the previously placed target point mapped onto the corresponing location in the brain.
									From here, the user places an entry point, which creates a trajectory from the entry to the target. 
									The goal is to place the point in a location with a clear shot to the target, while having enough clearance from other structures.<br />
									This prototype was also used in a two phase user study. 
									Phase 1 had users place points inside multiple virtual objects using a single line and two lines, then having the result of both compared.
									Phase 2 had the users go through the surgical planning workflow and tested their accuracy and completion time against traditional surgical planning methods.
									This study was designed and conducted under the supervision of Dr. Yiming Xiao at Health-X Lab.

									<h2><a >Colorectal Cancer Classifier<br /></a></h2>
								</header>
								<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Colorectal Cancer.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Python Machine Learning project using Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) built in collaboration with 4 other developpers.<br /> 
									A ResNet-18 CNN model was trained for colorectal cancer tissue classicifcation while addressing overfitting concerns and optimizing computational efficiency, then tested on new colorectal cancer tissue data.<br />
									The model was subsequently tested on two new data sets, prostate tissue patches and animal faces, to explore knowledge transfer between domains using supervised (SVM) and unsupervised techniques for feature classification. 
									Our model was compared against a pretrained model from ImageNet. 
									The final results showed that knowledge transfer was more effective with datasets from similar domains.</p>

										<h2><a >Trade boat navigation Simulator</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Trade Boat.JPG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project is a simulator built using Unity that uses an AI agent to navigate a trade boat between ports to deliver packages. <br /> 
										This simulator has 10 stages, each adding complexities to the map. 
										The trade boat's AI will allow it to take the fastest route between ports while avoiding collisions with obstacles and other ships, while also fleeing from pirate ships that seek out the trade ship.<br /> 
										The final level give control of the primary trade boat to the player, as they compete against other AI trade boats to score the most points within the time limit by delivering packages without crashes.

									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/splat.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Splat is an 3D arcade style game built with Unity in collaboration with two other developpers.<br /> 
										In this game, the player is a bird that flies around trying to poop on specific people, who are roaming around the city, to score points. 
										If they keep pooping on the correct target they will build a score multiplier.<br />
										As they do so, the cities defences will fight back, shooting at the player. If the player is hit, they lose momentum and points.

									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Fruit Fuser.JPG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Fruit Fuser is a Match 3 game built in Unity.<br /> 
										Swap two neighbouring fruits to make a match that is at least 3 long to score points. The bigger the match, the more points scored. <br /> 
										If a cascading match happens from the removal of the previously matched fruits, that match scores bonus points, increasing with each cascading match. 
										To complete the level, a minimum number of each fruit must be matched within the time limit and swap limit. The game consists of two levels, each with their own fruit spawning rules.

										<h2><a >Slime-O-Tron-9000<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Slime-o-tron.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Slime-O-Tron-9000 is a movement based puzzle game made using Unity for the Lost Relic Games Game Jam 2022 in collaboration with 2 other developpers. <br /> 
										In this game, the player controls 3 connected slimes simultaniously and must move them to the goal area on the stage. 
										The slimes each leave a trail behind them which kills another slime if it walks on it. Red dies to Blue which dies to Yellow which dies to Red.<br /> 
										When the player moves the slimes, they all move in the same direction and each obstacle in the stage will progress one stage. For example, and arrow that is in flight will also move forward one tile each time the player moves.
										The puzzles are designed around positioning the slimes appropriately and timing their movement around obstacles.

									<p>Where the Past Meets the Present is a stealth puzzle game built with Unity in collaboration with two other developpers.<br /> 
										The player is lost in the Forest of Time and they need to retrieve 4 gems from foxes that have stolen them from the time altar in order to fix time. 
										Portals have opened which allow the player to move between time periods (past, present, future). <br /> 
										The player must navigate between these time periods to successfully retrieve all the gems and avoid the foxes that can steal them back from you.
										The foxes work together to corner the player and become more aggressive as the player is spotted more and has more gems.

											<h2><a >Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock Battle Arena</a></h2>
										</header>
										<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/RPSLS.JPG" alt="" /></a>
										<p>This Unity project simulates 5 teams of 10 AI agents, each representing rocks, papers, scissors, lizards, and Spocks, in an a shrinking arena. <br /> 
											Each team tries to seek agents from teams they beat while fleeing from teams they lose to and not running into walls or out of the arena. 
											Each agent spawn in a random location in the arena. When an agent touches another agent that defeats them or if they run out of the map, they are eliminated.
											The simulation ends when one team is completely eliminated. <br /> 
											Rock beats scissors and lizards. Scissors beats paper and lizards. Paper beats rock and Spock. Lizard beats Spock and paper. Spock beats scissors and rock.

										<h2><a >Planet Generator</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Planet Generator.JPG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>A planet generator built using OpenGL. Upon running the program, a sphere is generated, seperated into 3 to 7 continents and an ocean, then rendered. <br /> 
										The sphere is approximated using an icosphere to guarantee each neighbouring vertice is equidistant. The icosphere is subdivided 3 to 5 times so better aproximate the sphere shape. <br /> 
										The continents are formed using a modified K-mean clustering with early stopping to vary the size of each continent and ensure an ocean exists.<br /> 
										The elevation of each vertice is determined using perlin noise. The noise value is used as an offset from the radius of the icosphere for continent vertices. For ocean vertices the value is used for depth but the height of the vertex is not changed.<br /> 
										Each contient is assigned a color range (can be repeated for multiple continents). Typically, higher elevation is lighter, and lower is darker. The color between vertices is a blend between the colors of the nearby vertices.<br /> 
										The planet can be generated with varuing radius, number of subdivisions, continents, and type of planet (possible color ranges and ocean). These must be set before running the program.

										<h2><a >Raytracer</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/cornel_box.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>A Raytracer built using C++. <br /> 
										It takes a JSON file that describes the geometry (quads and spheres) and light sources of the scene as an input. 
										The raytracer then traces each ray that passes from each pixel on the screen (~100 per pixel) that aims towards each light source in the scene.<br /> 
										If the ray reaches at least one light source, it will send the color of the surface it hit back to the pixel to contribute to the pixel's color. 
										If no light source is reached, then it is considered occluded and is considered black. 
										An average is then taken for the final color of the pixel. Anti-aliasing is used to provide softer shadows, smoother edges, and color blending. <br />
										Each ray that is shot from the camera can bounce up to 3 times before bouncing towards a light source. 
										This raytracer only takes into account diffuse and ambiant light.
